## Description

Built with React.js and using data from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)'s [API](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3).

The current top 10 [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) (by market cap) are displayed at the top of the page.

You can click one of the top 10 to see current it's current & historical price or search for
any other cryptocurrency by name using the search bar.

Once a cryptocurrency has been selected and it's data is displayed, you can change the fiat currency (eg. AUD)
that it is being compared to. You can also adjust the timeframe of the historical price chart to various lengths between 7 days and 1 year.

The current price of the chosen cryptocurrency will appear in red if it's less than it was yesterday or green if it's greater than yesterday's price.

### 'Favorites' Update (Oct. 2021):

You can [log in](https://crypto-watch.netlify.app/sign-in) using an email and password or using your Google or Twitter account.

You can click the star icon to save the cryptocurrency you are viewing as a favorite.

You can remove the favorite by clicking the same star icon again.

Your favorite cryptocurrencies will be listed before any others in the navigation bar so you can view them quickly without having to search for them.
