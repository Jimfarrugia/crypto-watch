Check the current and historical prices of cryptocurrencies.

### Phase 1 - MVP

1. I can see a list of popular cryptocurrencies.
2. When I select an item from the list, I can see it's price chart.
3. When I am viewing a price chart, it will live-update every 30 seconds.
4. I can search for other cryptocurrencies by their name or symbol.
